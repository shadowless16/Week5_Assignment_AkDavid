# Part 1: Randomization (30 points) 
# Task 1: Dice Roller Simulation (10 points) 
# ● Write a Python program that simulates rolling two six-sided dice. ● The program should generate two random integers between 1 and 6. ● Add the results together and print the total. 
import random

print("Welcome to the Randomization application")

roll_dice1 = print(random.randint(1, 6))

roll_dice2 = print(random.randint(1, 6))

print("Total:", random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6))

# print("Rolling dice:",  roll_dice1 + roll_dice2)
